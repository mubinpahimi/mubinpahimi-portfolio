# Razer Fintech — Tailwind-Based Design System
**Case Study**  
Role: UI/UX Designer  

Razer Fintech is a leading digital payment and financial services platform. The team needed a scalable design system to improve efficiency, maintain consistency, and speed up collaboration between design and development.

## Problem
- Developers struggled to translate designs into Tailwind code due to inconsistent components and unclear guidelines.  
- Designers had to recreate UI elements repeatedly for new screens.  
- Lack of a standardized system caused visual inconsistencies and slowed feature delivery.  

**Objective:** Create a Tailwind-based design style guide and Figma system to streamline design-to-development workflow, ensure consistency, and improve efficiency.

---

## Research & Insights
- Conducted a UI audit of existing screens and components.  
- Interviewed developers to identify friction points in implementing designs.  

**Key Insights:**  
- Developers needed predefined Tailwind classes for all UI elements.  
- Design inconsistencies caused repeated feedback cycles.  
- A centralized style guide would reduce errors and accelerate development.

## UX/UI Process

### 1. Tailwind Style Guide & Component Audit
- Mapped all colors, typography, spacing, and shadows to Tailwind classes.  
- Audited existing components (buttons, cards, forms, tables, modals) and identified reusable elements.  
- Standardized responsive design tokens for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### 2. Figma Design System
- Built a Figma library fully aligned with Tailwind.  
- Components include default, hover, active, and disabled states.  
- Layouts, spacing, and grids mapped to Tailwind utilities.  
- Naming conventions standardized for quick developer adoption.

### 3. Documentation & Developer Handoff
- Created usage guidelines for each component and layout.  
- Included Tailwind class references directly in Figma for developers.  
- Prepared templates for common screens and flows to accelerate future design work.

### 4. Iteration & Validation
- Collected feedback from developers during implementation.  
- Adjusted components and interactions for ease of coding, scalability, and consistency.

## Outcome
- Delivered a complete Tailwind-based design system in Figma, reducing design-to-development friction.  
- Improved feature delivery speed by allowing developers to reuse components without ambiguity.  
- Ensured visual consistency across all products and screens.  
- Created a scalable system that supports future growth and new modules.

## Reflection
By utilizing Tailwind as the core of the design style guide, I created a system that bridges design and code. The project emphasized component reusability, consistency, and efficiency, making design handoff faster and more reliable, and empowering the team to scale product features with confidence.
