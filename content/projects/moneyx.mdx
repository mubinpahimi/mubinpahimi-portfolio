## Overview
MoneyX is an AI-powered personal finance management app that helps users track, manage, and optimize their finances effortlessly. The app offers a comprehensive suite of financial services, from investment and banking to credit management, insurance, and renewable energy partnerships. The goal was to create a unified, intuitive, and engaging experience that simplifies complex financial information and empowers users to make informed financial decisions.

## Role
**Senior UI/UX Designer** – Worked on the end-to-end design process, including user research, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and visual design. Collaborated with product managers, developers, and stakeholders to ensure a seamless, scalable, and technically feasible user experience.

## Problem
Managing personal finances can be overwhelming, especially when users have multiple accounts, loans, credit cards, insurance policies, and investment goals. Many financial apps either focus on a single service or present information in confusing, cluttered ways.  

For MoneyX, the challenge was designing a cohesive platform that consolidates diverse financial services into one seamless experience. This meant simplifying complex data, making AI-driven insights actionable, and providing a clear, intuitive interface for both novice and advanced users. Integrating third-party services like CTOS, Credit Bureau Malaysia, and renewable energy partners added complexity that needed to be invisible to the user but functional behind the scenes.
