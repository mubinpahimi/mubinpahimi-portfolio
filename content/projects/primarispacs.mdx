# Prima RIS/PACS — UX & Interface Redesign
**Case study**  
Published on January, 2023 · 5 min read  

I worked as a UI/UX Designer on Prima RIS/PACS, a web-based imaging archive for clinics, hospitals, and imaging centers. The project focused on improving usability, streamlining workflows, and delivering a consistent experience for multi-site facilities.

## Overview
Prima RIS/PACS supports any imaging modality, unlimited users and workstations, and can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud. Multi-site facilities are supported with real-time synchronized data. The system is vendor-neutral, making it adaptable for facilities of any size.

## Problem
Healthcare providers faced several challenges:  
- Complex and siloed systems were difficult to navigate and scale  
- Multi-site operations struggled with data synchronization  
- Outdated, unintuitive interfaces led to long training times and workflow inefficiencies  

**Objective:** Redesign the UX to improve usability, streamline workflows, and deliver a consistent experience for multi-site facilities.

## Research & Insights
- **User Interviews:** Conducted with radiologists, clinicians, and IT administrators to uncover workflow pain points  
- **Task Analysis:** Observed how users accessed patient studies, reports, and imaging data across sites  
- **Competitive Benchmarking:** Studied similar RIS/PACS systems to identify usability gaps  

**Key Insights:**  
- Clinicians need fast, easy access to patient studies and histories  
- Multi-step workflows increase cognitive load and risk of error  
- Real-time data synchronization must be transparent and reliable

## UX Process

### 1. Information Architecture & Workflow Mapping
- Mapped end-to-end imaging workflows from patient registration to reporting  
- Reorganized navigation for modality-specific operations and multi-site support  
- Ensured minimal clicks to complete tasks while keeping information clear  

### 2. Wireframing & Prototyping
- Designed mobile-first wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes for dashboards, patient studies, and reporting modules  
- Focused on task efficiency, highlighting key patient and imaging information  
- Developed interactive prototypes to simulate multi-site synchronization and real-time updates  

### 3. Visual & Interaction Design
- Created a clean, professional, and intuitive interface suitable for medical users  
- Emphasized visual hierarchy, progress indicators, and interactive elements to reduce cognitive load  
- Designed components that guide users through critical workflows seamlessly  

### 4. Usability Testing & Iteration
- Conducted task-based usability tests with radiologists and admin staff  
- Iterated designs to improve filtering, study access, reporting, and multi-site visibility  
- Incorporated feedback to ensure workflows were efficient, clear, and error-resistant

## Outcome
- Delivered a scalable, user-centered RIS/PACS interface for multi-site facilities  
- Streamlined workflows for clinicians and administrators, reducing cognitive load and improving efficiency  
- Improved multi-site synchronization transparency for accurate data across locations  
- Established a cohesive UX system for future updates and feature expansions  
- Enhanced user confidence and trust in a high-stakes clinical environment
